# SOLID


### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

A class or a module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.

Every module or class should have responsability over a single part of a functionality provided by the software, and the responsability should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

Single: only one, isolated, by itself VS God Object (anti-pattern)

Responsibility: the work or action that each part of your system, the methods, classes, packages, modules are assigned to do
